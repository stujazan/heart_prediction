## Heart-Disease-Prediction 

### Overview

A simple web application which uses Machine Learning algorithm to predict the heart condition of a person by providing some inputs about the person health like age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol level etc built using `Flask` and deployed on `Heroku`.



### Installation

The Code is written in Python 3.8. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

*To clone the repository*

```
git clone https://github.com/asthasharma98/Heart-Disease-Prediction-Deployment.git
```

### Run 

*To Run the Application*

```
python app.py
```

### Deployement on Heroku

Install Heroku CLI as this makes it easy to create and manage your Heroku apps directly from the terminal. 
You can download it from [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

next step would be to follow the instruction given on [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) to deploy a web app.
